### My Leetcode Project

Welcome to my Leetcode project, this is a repository where I'll copy/pase my Leetcode answers. Maybe down the line I'll add some integrations and some Git Actions to automate the testing of my submissions, but there'll be a lot to figure out!

My aim for this project is to brush-up my skills. As primarily a web developer I tend to use Typescript to make pretty websites, yet I have a whole CS degree and a master's under my belt which mostly remains unutilised. I want to use this as a way to keep my skills up on some languages I've learnt over time, and solve some complex problems using techniques that a web developer typically doesn't get to practice.

If you stumble across this at whatever stage I'm at in the project, welcome! Feel free to snoop around and ask questions, I'm not precious about my code!
